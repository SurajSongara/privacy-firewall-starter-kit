"""PyInstaller build recipe for the Privacy Firewall desktop app.

One spec drives all three desktops; the platform-specific bits (icon format,
macOS .app bundle) branch on ``sys.platform``. Build with:

    pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm packaging/privacy_firewall.spec

Produces a *onedir* bundle at ``dist/PrivacyFirewall/``. onedir (not onefile)
is deliberate: it avoids the onefile temp-extraction startup lag and draws
markedly fewer Windows antivirus false positives. The native installer hides
the folder from the user anyway.

Names like ``Analysis``, ``PYZ``, ``EXE``, ``COLLECT``, ``BUNDLE`` and
``SPECPATH`` are injected by PyInstaller when it executes this file.
Targets PyInstaller >= 6 (the ``cipher`` argument was removed in 6.0).

# never sees them. The Studio HTML/JS is a Python string in ui/html.py, so
# there are no template data files to collect.
hiddenimports += collect_submodules("uvicorn")

# package *data*, and onnxruntime's inference engine is a native library.

# --- Engine -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Detectors/adapters are resolved through registries, so pull the whole package
# in rather than relying on the static import graph. The Tesseract/Paddle OCR
# adapters are deliberately left out (see EXCLUDES): the registry in
# ocr/__init__.py registers adapters behind try/except ImportError, so the
# bundle degrades cleanly to the RapidOCR backend it actually ships.
